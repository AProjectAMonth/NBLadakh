As it is the first repository of our initiative AProjectAMonth, let's start it simple. We have very basic technologies used so that even a begineer can contribute to the project and don't feel left out. Collaborative development if our motto here. :)

# Technology Used 

<strong>@ Front End</strong>
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap
5. Jquery

<strong>@ Back End</strong>
1. Django
2. Instagram API

Anyone who want their code to reflect here can create a pull request to the repository. 
Happy Coding! :)
